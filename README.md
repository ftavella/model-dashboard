# Dashboard for interactive model exploration :detective:

Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are widely used in science, engineering, and medicine. However, when building a new model, it is typically necessary to explore how the model's output depends on its underlying parameters.

The code here provides a tool for exploring an ODE model interactively. A Dash WebApp is generated with plots for each variable and interactive sliders for each parameter.

The model is defined in an input script that specifies the model's variables, parameters, and equations. See the `examples` folder for some samples.

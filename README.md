# Dashboard for interactive model exploration :detective:

Ordinary differential equation (ODE) are widely used in science, engineering, and medicine. However, when building a new model, it is typically necessary to explore how its output depends on the underlying parameters.

The code here provides a tool for exploring an ODE interactively. A Dash WebApp is generated with plots for each variable and sliders for each parameter.

An input script specifies the model's variables, parameters, and equations. See the `examples` folder for some samples.
